In this chapter of "The Alchemist," we are introduced to the main character, Santiago, who is a young Andalusian shepherd. Santiago is somewhat dissatisfied with his monotonous life, where every day is the same, tending to his flock of sheep as they graze in the fields. Despite being content with his simple existence, he feels an underlying restlessness, a yearning to explore the world beyond the fields. Santiago's recurring dream about finding treasure at the foot of the Egyptian pyramids deeply intrigues him, sparking within him a desire for adventure and the pursuit of his personal legend.

One day, while Santiago is grazing his sheep near Tarifa, he encounters a young woman, who introduces herself as an old woman, but in reality, she is a gypsy. The gypsy tells him that she can interpret dreams and offers to help Santiago understand the recurring vision he has been having. Santiago hesitates at first, but eventually, he shares his dream with the gypsy. She advises him to follow his dream and seek the treasure he envisions, as it may hold the key to fulfilling his personal legend. The old woman asks for a portion of the treasure once Santiago finds it, as an act of gratitude for her guidance.

Santiago continues on his journey with his flock of sheep, ruminating on the advice he received from the gypsy. He wonders if he should abandon his familiar life and venture into the unknown, in search of hidden treasures. Although afraid of change and uncertain of what lies ahead, he cannot ignore the strong pull of his dream and the longing for something greater.

As Santiago crosses the fields of Andalusia, he stops at an old church and reflects upon his life's purpose.

With these thoughts swirling in his mind, Santiago decides to consult a prestigious and respected man known as Melchizedek, the King of Salem, who is rumored to possess mystical powers. Melchizedek is aware of Santiago's recurring dream and assures him that the dream holds great significance; he must not disregard it. Melchizedek offers his wisdom and tells Santiago about the importance of following one's own destiny, urging him to pay attention to the omens and signs the universe puts in his path.
