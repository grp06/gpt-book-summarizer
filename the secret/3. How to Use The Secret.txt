In the chapter "How to Use The Secret" from the book "The Secret" by Rhonda Byrne, the author delves deep into the practical application of the Law of Attraction, the fundamental premise on which the book is based. 

The chapter begins by reiterating the core principles of the Law of Attraction stating that what we think about the most or focus on becomes our reality. Byrne asserts that thoughts are magnetic, sending out frequencies that attract similar frequencies from the universe. 

Byrne then moves onto how to practically apply the Secret in day to day life. She emphasizes the importance of positive thinking and visualisation. She advocates for clear mental images of what one wishes to achieve or attain, coupled with the conviction that the desired end result is already theirs. 

The author introduces the three-step process: Ask, Believe, and Receive. In asking, one must be clear about what they want without focusing on the negatives. In believing, one must act and think like they already received what they asked for. In receiving, one should feel the way they would feel when their wish is manifested. Byrne underscores the importance of feelings, stating that they are the feedback system of the soul, guiding us towards the right path.

She also details the role of gratitude in using the secret, explaining that being thankful for what we already have will attract more things to be grateful for. 

Byrne also discusses the implications of the Law of Attraction on health, wealth, and relationships. By harnessing the power of thought, she suggests that one can even cure their illnesses, become rich or foster healthy relationships. 

The author explains that merely thinking positively isn't enough. The real power comes from feeling, so one must also feel positive, not just think positively. Byrne emphasizes that negative feelings counteract the power of positive thoughts and therefore, consciously assessing and altering feelings play a crucial role in manifesting one's desires.

The chapter ends with Byrne encouraging readers to start with small things, to test the Secret, and then move onto their bigger desires or goals. She insists that belief plays a crucial role, without which the universe cannot deliver the desires. 

Overall, in the chapter explaining 'How to Use The Secret', Byrne simplifies the Law of Attraction and its practical application to positively change ones life according to their specific needs and desires. She emphasizes the power of thoughts, feelings, belief, and gratitude in this process.
