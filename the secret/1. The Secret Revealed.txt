"The Secret Revealed" is the opening chapter of Rhonda Byrne's bestselling self-help book "The Secret". This chapter sets the foundation for the rest of the book, laying out Byrne's proposal of the concept of "the Secret". 

"The Secret Revealed" opens with Byrne detailing her personal life crisis, the time when she was despondent and lost. During this period of intense personal struggle, her daughter gifted her a 100-year-old book. Byrne does not name the book, but it's her discovery and reading of this book that turns out to be her epiphany. From this unnamed book, she learns 'the secret' which she claims to be the single principle that's been at the core of the most successful and influential people in history.

Rhonda Byrne then divulges "The Secret" itself which she identifies as the Law Of Attraction. This law, as she explains, states that the thoughts and feelings a person emits to the universe will directly influence and manifest their reality. In essence, if one thinks positively and exerts positive energy, their life will reflect the same and vice versa with negative energy. She clarifies that the secret is not just about acquiring material wealth or success but can be applied to any aspect of one's life, be it health, relationships or career.

The chapter continues with Byrne mentioning how this Secret has been known and used by prominent people throughout history, such as Plato, Newton, Carnegie, Beethoven, and Einstein. She embarks on a journey to explore, understand, and explain this universal principle clearly to the masses. 

The chapter concludes with Byrne impressing upon the reader that understanding the Law of Attraction is, by itself, a powerful tool. Once understood and employed correctly, it can bring about a significant positive change in the reader's life - using a kind of magnetic power of the mind to achieve goals and obtain what one wishes for.
